# CS255-Portfolio

Our client was a company knwon as Driver Pass, which is essentially a company dedicated to helping people pass their driving test through practice test, scheduling actual driving lessons, and packaged content to study.
The system we created is known as a LMS or Learning Management system, which essentially helps customers schedule driving lessons, study content, and take tests to help them get thier drivers License. 
If I could fix anything about these documents, it would be to go into more detail when it comes to security, and how we would properly implement that into the driver pass system, what security measures we would use, dependency test, hash algorithms, etc.
We interpreted users needs through an interview transcript, this is extremely importnant because knowing a users needs allows you to set up a system that works not only to favor the company, but the user also. In amazon we are told to have customer obsession, which essentially means we put the customer first, because without the customer, the bussiness is useless. 
I Loved the idea of using different diagrams, it really breaks down what the main goal of the system is, and the different components within the system being built. I also liked the idea of interviewing the client, and getting as much information as possible from them when it comes to designing the desired system.
